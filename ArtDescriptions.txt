1. Swordsman (Angelic background)
Description: A fully armored humanoid being, covered in blood-red platemail. He is able to nimbly wield a slab of a broadsword, which is almost as tall as himself.
Ability:The swordsman swings his sword in a crushing over-head slash with such determination that a memory of a sword long-gone manifests in the process, slicing off into the distance.

2. Archer (Angelic background)
Description: An archer covered in a patchwork of leather armor, augmented in a few places by some green dye. A hood covers her face, but her white flowing hair manages to find its way out.
Ability: The archer fires an arrow with such precision that it splits open space and time itself, opening a rift in front of her where hundreds of copies of the arrow rain down upon her foes.

3. Poison (Angelic background)
Description: Black flowing robes, shrouded  in mystery. A decaying skeletal mask adorns his face, which can be seen if you ever have the misfortune of attracting his gaze.
Ability: Calls forth a scalding acidic rain, fueled by his very being. As a prerequisite for this unleashment, he returns to his angelis roots; the shadow wings rife with poisoned, cancerous veins grow out, flexing, and disappear once it is over.
