Leveling Up
* Last-minute inspiration from Battlerite/Nuclear Throne
* How much do invisible stat level ups matter? Do we need them?
	- No. Either your other ability's become pointless, or you level everything up, in which case... why not have that happen automatically?

* Card-style system, unique to each player character
* Upgrades periodically, currently shooting for end of level, could be in-game (if there is time to figure them out)

Movement
* Large levels full of medium sized mostly flat areas, interconnected with platforms, ladders, and jump jets. Very little "pixel perfect jump" platforming
