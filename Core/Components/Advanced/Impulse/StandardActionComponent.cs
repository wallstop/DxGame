        All Abilities or Actions should end up boiling down to one of the categories
        enumerated below. The strength of enumerating these categories is that we can
        convey information about what an ability does to the behavior layer. This allows
        us to "pick" what ability to use, if any, for a behavior in a somewhat intelligent
        fashion. Without this categorization, we would have to essentially "try every ability"
        to see what effects they had, and build in intelligent ways to determine the effects!
        That's really hard.
