        DrawableComponent forms the base of all Components that wish to be rendered at some point in time.
        Each derived class must implement their own LoadContent and Draw methods, which will be called
        in the main LoadContent and Draw methods. 

        Components using this class will typically be sprites, with or without animations. Particle effects, etc.
